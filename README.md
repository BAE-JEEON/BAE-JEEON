### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Je-Eon Bae, a student to become a machine learning engineer.

My goal is to become an engineer who maximizes economic and societal value through machine learning. To achieve this goal, I am researching to make machine learning technology more accessible to people from all backgrounds.

Currently, my research is focused on two specific areas: Data-efficient Learning and Interpretable neural networks.
